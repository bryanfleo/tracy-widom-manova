# tracy-widom-manova
This was my final scientific paper in the course of Capita Selecta in Statistics A instructed by Atina Husnaqilati, S.Si., M.Sc., Ph.D. in 2023. Together with Agnes F. Chrisnanda, Daud M. Azhari, and R. A. Callysta S. Calyacetta, we implemented Tracy-Widom distribution as an approximation method for MANOVA involving large dataset.
